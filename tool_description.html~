<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
For each of the control buttons on the Reversible Transcription Intake page (e.g., Ottoman Arabic),
there is a php script that is invoked when the button is clicked. The scripts are passed the contents
of the Input Text Area and the contents of the Metadata fields and return the formatted output. These
script files are as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
reverse_ottoman_arabic.php<br/>
reverse_ottoman_latin.php<br/>
reverse_ottoman_turkish.php<br/>
reverse_ottoman_cyrillic.php<br/>
reverse_xml.php
</em></blockquote>
<p>
Each of these scripts works in a very similar fashion. Each loads a file of substitution rules that are
used to perform the transcription. Any tags (e.g., "<italic>") in the input text area are removed and saved
for later reinsertion. This is also true of html entity references (e.g., "#&1576;"). Both of these are removed
so the application of the substitution rules will not mangle them. Incidental whitespace in the input is
simply discarded. The substitution rules are then applied. The rules are in the form:
</p>
<blockquote>
"B7" -> "+1576;", /* Arabic Letter Beh */
</blockquote>
<p>
In this example, a "B7" in the input will be replaced by "+1576;" which is an entity reference for the
Arabic Letter Beh. The "+" will be replaced by "#&" right before the final output. "*" and "**" are used to
mark line breaks and line group breaks respectively. Line breaks are done with div tags and line groups
have a p tag surrounding the groups of lines, each with its own div tag. The code in each script
is commented if more detail is needed about its specific operation.
</p>
<p>
In the file of substitution rules, the rules are listed in the order they will be applied, separated by commas. Anything between "/*" and "*/" is a comment and can used to add documentation. Each part of the rule is in quotes so that white space in the input can be interpreted correctly as needed. These are two distinct substitution rules:
</p>
<blockquote>
" B7" -> " +1576;",<br/>
"B7" -> "+1576;",
</blockquote>
<p>
The rules are applied in the order they appear in the rules file. When adding rules, one must consider where
to order them in the list. In the two rules shown above, applying the rule without the space first would almost
certainly prevent the one with the space from ever being applied.
</p>
<p>
The rules files are as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><em>
ottoman_arabic_rules.txt<br/>
ottoman_cyrillic_rules.txt<br/>
ottoman_latin_rules.txt<br/>
ottoman_turkish_rules.txt
</em></blockquote>
<p>
The XML php script uses the same rules file as the Ottoman Arabic. There is also a set of rules in the file
"dynamic_chart_rules.txt". This is used to dynamically generate a table of all the substitution rules with a
brief descriptive note. This chart is intended primarily for debugging purposes for the person modifying or
adding rules to the transcription rules files.
</p>
